#Melo

Melo is an open source software framework for communication in embedded systems. Melo's format is inspired by both
XCP by ASAM and UDS (ISO 15765-3 and ISO 14229-3) but designed for even the smallest 8-bit controllers. In addition
Melo is designed to easily interface with any physical communication channel such as: I2C, SPI, or RS-232.

## Direct Memory Access

As a built-in feature Melo provides a direct interface to the controller's memory. This allows a user to view
and/or modify variables usign memory addresses.

### Determining Memory Address using Arduino

```bash
# 
$ 
```
